# ResourceTracker

An enhanced fork of [memoryprofiler](https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/memoryprofiler).

The extra benefits:

- *Snapshot-Diff* Multiple snapshots comparison

- *Text Searching* full text searching among all memory objects (with type-grouped results)

- *Alloc Tracking* The source-code allocation point backtracking of a given memory block

- Contains a formulated test project (a sample scene with recommended usage)

Minor fixes:

- namespace inconsistencies fixed
